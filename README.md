# JavaScript-Project

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! ðŸš€

I'm currently learning JavaScript and using this space to build and document various mini-projects and exercises as I go. Each folder in this repository contains a separate project, complete with source code, description, and implementation details.

## ðŸ§  What you'll find here:
- Hands-on practice with core JavaScript concepts
- DOM manipulation projects
- Event handling examples
- API integration demos
- Fun mini-games and utilities
